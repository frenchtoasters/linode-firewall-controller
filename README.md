# linode-firewall-controller
The linode-firewall-controller extends support for Linode Cloud Firewalls to LKE.
## Description
linode-firewall-controller is designed to run within an LKE cluster to extend support for Linode Cloud Firewalls. It implements a controller for a new CRD, ClusterwideNetworkPolicy, which allows a user to specify a set of egress and ingress rules to be applied to all cluster nodes at layer3/4 (IPIP support coming soon). For each ClusterwideNetworkPolicy, a Linode Cloud Firewall is provisioned and configured to the specifications. When Kuberenetes Nodes are created or deleted, the Firewall is automatically updated.

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need an LKE cluster to run against. An LKE cluster can be deployed via the Linode Cloud Manager[cloud.linode.com], APIv4[developers.linode.com], or the Linode CLI[https://www.linode.com/docs/products/tools/cli/get-started/]

### Running on the cluster
1. Install the ClusterwideNetworkPolicy Custom Resource Definition and linode-firewall-controller:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/crd
kubectl apply -k config/manager
kubectl apply -k config/rbac
```
2. Deploy a ClusterwideNetworkPolicy resource
Create a new ClusterwideNetworkPolicy, or use the provided sample manifest to get started:
```sh
kubectl apply -k config/sample
```

Example ClusterwideNetworkPolicy:
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.linode.com/v1alpha1
kind: ClusterwideNetworkPolicy
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: clusterwidenetworkpolicy
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: clusterwidenetworkpolicy-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: linode-firewall-controller
    app.kuberentes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: linode-firewall-controller
  name: clusterwidenetworkpolicy-sample
spec:
  ingress:
  # allow web traffic from 172.0.0.0/12
  - from:
    - cidr: 172.0.0.0/12
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  # allow egress DNS to all private network addresses
  - to:
    - cidr: 192.168.128.0/17
    ports:
    - protocol: UDP
      port: 53
```

### Developing
1. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:
	
```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/linode-firewall-controller:tag
```
	
2. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/linode-firewall-controller:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller to the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Contributing
// TODO(user): Add detailed information on how you would like others to contribute to this project

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/) 
which provides a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources untile the desired state is reached on the cluster 

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
